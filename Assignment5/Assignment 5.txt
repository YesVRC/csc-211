Section 1:
- Testing a function requires the function's to be checked using an assert function that takes the expected value then the function call.
- Tests must have the @Test annotation, which allows the function test to show a pass or fail plus some more information.

Section 2: 
- DisplayName names the test in the terminal/test suite
- Assertions test for pass or fail
- Assumptions can be used to terminate tests before completion if conditions are/aren't met

Section 3:
- RepeatedTest can be used to repeat tests a certain number of times
- A RepetitionInfo parameter can be added to the test method to get information about the Repetition.
- ParameterizedTest can be used to pass an array of values to test multiple cases
- ValueSource can be used to pass values where EnumSource can be used to pass an Enum/certain values of the Enum
- CSVSource can be used to pass a CSV representation (Comma Separated Values) and it can have multiple parameters assigned to them (500, Bob => int age, String name for example)
- Timeouts can be set to limit how long a function can attempt to run for
- Parallel Execution can be used to use more threads and speed up overall testing time
